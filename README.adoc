= Change Data Capture with Debezium (on OpenShift 4.3) =

This demo shows how you can install Debezium on an OpenShift 4.3 (and above) cluster.

There is a small app at the heart of the demo that is writing to a MySQL database (it's added to this repo as a submodule).

We start with that app and slowly add the following:

1. Use operators to install AMQ Streams on the cluster (pre-requisite for Debezium)
2. Setup KafkaConnectS2I
3. Build and install the Debezium Connector for MySQL
4. Demonstrate change events coming through Debezium 
5. Use fuse to transform events coming out of the Database for feeding into Elastisearch
6. Publish connector metrics to central OpenShift Monitoring
7. Install a custom grafana dashboard to visualize metrics

== Initial Project and App Setup ==

First log into an OpenShift 4.3 cluster using an account with cluster-admin privileges.

First thing that needs to be done is to deploy the original application including a MySQL database that is ready to be connected to Debezium.

----
$DEMO_HOME/scripts/00-setup-app.sh
----

As part of this process, the current user will be granted `anyuid` scc privileges as this is required for the debezium provided databasefootnote:database[MySQL databases need to be configured to write their transactions to the rowlevel `binlog` (among other things).  The MySQL database that is used in this demo is from a debezium image and is already setup in this way.  If you use a different MySQL image you will need to ensure the MySQL database is configured correctly as outlined link:https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.0/connectors/mysql.html#setting-up-mysql[here]]

The script will also create the database and check that the schema has been created correctly.

If all went well, the last lines of output should look like this:footnote:[If output does not match then you can look into link:/scripts/00-setup-app.sh[the shell script] for where things went wrong and run the commands manually]
