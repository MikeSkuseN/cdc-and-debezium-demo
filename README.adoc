= Change Data Capture with Debezium (on OpenShift 4.3)=

This demo shows how you can install Debezium on an OpenShift 4.3 (and above) cluster.

There is a small app at the heart of the demo that is writing to a MySQL database (it's added to this repo as a submodule).  

[red]#FIXME: Add image of app#

We start with that app and slowly add the following:

1. Use operators to install AMQ Streams on the cluster (pre-requisite for Debezium)
2. Setup KafkaConnectS2I
3. Build and install the Debezium Connector for MySQL
4. Demonstrate change events coming through Debezium 
5. Use fuse to transform events coming out of the Database for feeding into Elastisearch
6. Publish connector metrics to central OpenShift Monitoring
7. Install a custom grafana dashboard to visualize metrics
